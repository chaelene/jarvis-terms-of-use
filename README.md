# Jarvis Companion Terms of Use

**Effective Date: October 22, 2025**

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of Jarvis Companion ("the Skill"), a fan-inspired Alexa skill for voice commands like camera scans and AI jokes. "We," "us," or "our" refers to the developer of this unofficial fan project. By enabling the Skill, you agree to these Terms.

- **Restrictions**: No modification, reverse-engineering, resale, or commercial use. No use for illegal activities or spamming.

## Skill Functionality
- Commands (e.g., "scan the room") control compatible cameras (e.g., TP-Link Tapo) and generate AI responses via secure APIs.
- Prerequisites: Stable internet, compatible hardware; supported on US Alexa devices.

## Disclaimers & Liability
- **As-Is**: Provided "as is" without warranties. We disclaim liability for interruptions, errors, or damages (e.g., camera misfires).
- **IP Notice**: Inspired by Iron Man's Jarvis (no affiliation with Marvel/Disneyâ€”unofficial fan project). Trademarks used for reference only.
